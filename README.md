# VR2C

Visualize read-to-contig alignment.

### Motivation

Visualizing read-to-contig alignment could be difficult because the number of
contigs could be huge compared to a typical genome, which has only a few dozens
of contigs/chromosomes. It may be difficult to index the contig FASTA file and
load it into a genome browser like
[IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).
